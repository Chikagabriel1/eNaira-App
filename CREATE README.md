Product Name: eNaira connect

An Overview:
eNaira Connect bridges the gap between Nigeria’s digital currency, the eNaira, and existing banking systems. Many Nigerians are unaware the eNaira exists, or find it difficult to use separate apps for it. This product simplifies access by embedding eNaira functionality directly inside your bank’s mobile app — so you can manage both your regular bank funds and eNaira wallet in one place.


Problem Statement:
Despite being launched by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the eNaira has struggled with awareness and adoption. Users find the setup process complex, and switching between apps discourages use.


What eNaira Connect Does:

1. Integrates eNaira access directly into existing banking apps

2. Lets users switch between bank naira and eNaira accounts easily

3. Enables transactions like sending, receiving, converting, and saving in eNaira

4. Provides a simple onboarding flow that uses existing KYC from your bank


Who It’s For:

1. Everyday Nigerians using mobile banking apps

2. Financial institutions seeking to increase digital currency adoption

3. Regulators and fintechs exploring CBDC use cases


Key Features:

1. Dual wallet management (Bank + eNaira)

2. Fast onboarding using verified bank identity

3. Real-time conversion between naira and eNaira

4. Secure transactions via CBN and NIBSS network integration

5. Optional link to the full eNaira platform for advanced features (e.g., FX conversion, digital asset payments)
